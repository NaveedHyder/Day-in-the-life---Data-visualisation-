# Day-in-the-life : Data-visualisation
This code is a Pygame simulation that creates a visual representation of a day in the life of a SRM student. The program does not work with a dataset and instead uses the random function of Python to assign initial activities to the dots.

The code initializes Pygame, sets up the display window, defines the colors and positions of the different activities, and assigns initial activities to the dots. The program then enters the Pygame game loop, which continuously checks for events until it is exited.

Within the game loop, the program moves the dots towards the center of their current activity and randomly changes their activity once they reach the center. The circles representing the activities and the dots are drawn on the screen, and the display is updated.

It is important to note that this program is not designed to analyze any particular dataset or real-world data. Instead, it is a simple demonstration of Pygame's capabilities and how they can be used to create interactive and engaging visualizations. The program relies on the random function of Python to assign initial activities to the dots and simulate their movements.
